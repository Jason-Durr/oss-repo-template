Adding a license is important to clarify how users are allowed to use your code.  Without a license they can not be sure if they are allowed to use your code and as a result may be less likely to use it.  This defeats the purpose of making it open source in the first place and as a result should be avoidd.

You should not use a project without a license because without one you do not have permission to use their copyrighted work.  As a result they can at anytime seek damages against you and could take control ofall the work you did using their work.

I definetly agree with this claim because when a project like this which is intended to be used by developers is not open for developers to add features they want it is going to have a hard time gaining use.  This is because developers not only know what they want but also how it can be done and when you limit their feedback they are more likely to use a different product.

For android, the kernel uses a GPL v2 License which is the same one as Linux uses.  This makes sense becasue Android was developed from the Linux kernel and since the GPL v2 is a copy left license they are required to use the same license for their kernel.
